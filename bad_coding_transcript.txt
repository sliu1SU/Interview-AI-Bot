Ehhh, I am not sure about how to do this problem. I am guessing I need to do a for loop. I will iterate every element in the array. I will compare the ith element to the (i+1)th element as I go over the for loop. If I find a sum that equals the target, then I will return the corresponding indexes. Sorry, this is a very hard question for me, that is the best I can come up with. Not sure if it is correct though.
