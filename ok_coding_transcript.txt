Yes I can do this problem! I will do a nested for loop to basically check every possible pairs of elements in this array. During the loop, I will check if the pairs' sum equals to the target. If the answer is yes, I will return the pairs immediately. If by the time the nested for loop is finished, the return statement within never gets to executed, there is no answer. Then, I will return {0, 0}. I am not sure if there is a more efficient way of doing this problem, however.
