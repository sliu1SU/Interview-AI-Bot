This problem can be solved with a brute force method, generating all possible pairs of elements and return the first pair whose sum equals to target. But this approach is inefficient. Can we do better with a method with linear time complexity? Yes we can. I will use a hash table. As I iterate over every element in the array, I will first check if the hash table contains an element whose value = target - nums[i]. If the answer is yes, we found the answer! If not, then we can push this element into the hash table. Note: you always check if there is a compliment element before pushing the current element into the hash table. This will avoid checking the current element against itself.
