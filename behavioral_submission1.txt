One time, I helped a coworker with a small coding issue they were facing on a project that wasn't really related to my own work. They were struggling to get a function to run correctly, so I gave them some quick advice on debugging. I thought it might help them finish their project a bit faster. They eventually figured it out on their own, so it didn’t take up much of my time, but I’m not really sure if my input made a difference.
