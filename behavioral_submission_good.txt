In my current internship, my project is about creating a mobile app that can handle incoming missed phone calls. The company I working for is a start up and currently it does not have paying customer yet. I am part of the company and I am like, I can do more to help the company reach out to potential customers. I created an internal pipeline. The pipeline can go onto business websites such as Yelp and Houzz to scrap the business data, such as business name, phone number, address, and email. All the raw data is processed and then put into a formatted excel sheet. The CEO is using the sheet to contact the business on the list one by one. So far, I am very pleased to let you know that we are getting 20 paying customers on average!
This start-up is like my family. Instead of saying "this is not my job", I would actively find out areas that I am able to help.
